This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# MovieBox Details

This is a Next.js application that allows users to view detailed information about movies. It uses the TMDB API to fetch movie data and display it in a user-friendly interface and displaying top popular movies along with their release dates, ratings, and descriptions. This is a starting point, and i will further enhance the functionality to add more features.


## Features

- View detailed information about a selected movie.
- View detailed information about top popular movies.
- See release dates, ratings, descriptions, and more.
- Watch trailers and check showtimes.
- See information about the director, writers, and stars of the movie.
- Search movies in the search bar

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-details-app.git


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
